# Good-obsidian-notes plugin

This is a nice and free Obsidian plugin for making notes and solving tasks, if you have a touchpad and stylus. As you may notice, this is a replacement for some apps for notes, which subscriptions i was very lazy to buy. I didn't learn typescript or frontend app making even a day, so please don't judge for such a nice piece of code. There may be bugs, so if you are interested in improving or restructuring the project, you will be really welcome.

## How to work with it
